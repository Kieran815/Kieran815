## Hi! I'm Kieran and I develop Websites!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Microtrain Coding Bootcamp, in addition to freelance web development projects, mostly using JS and it's frameworks.
### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
AngularJS, and I am proficient in React. I like doing markdown for content editing since it sources so nicely with gatsby. PHP is WAY easier than I was trying to make it. Angular is legit, but I think I still prefer react because you have to build everything, which makes me love my code more. JavaScript is my favorite because it covers frontend and back end. I'm working with databases and sourcing. SQL is so straight forward.... But I see a big push in the future to mostly headless cms like firebase, aws, heroku and others. I think I want to become the fabled All-Powerful Front-End Developer. But you can feel free to hire me for whatever; I can totally do it all.

Note: I may have wiped out my git history pre-February 2020. I thought I was cleaning up my repos by adding them all to one directory and sourcing from there. I wasn't and it didn't... o_0 Made a big mess, but I have most of my repos pre-August 2020 fixed, when I began bootcamp. You live, you learn, you break it, you fix it. Thanks for your understanding and
