## Hi! I'm Kieran and I develop Websites!

### ðŸ”­ I build Single Page and Progressive Web Applications, mostly using JS and it's frameworks.
I enjoy working with JavaScript because I can do Front-End and Back-End development in the same language.
I am proficient in React. Angular is legit, but I still prefer react working in react because you have to build components from scratch, which makes me love my code more.  I like doing markdown for content editing since it sources so nicely with gatsby. I'm learning the finer points of back-end development and I enjoy JAM Stacks.
