## Hi! I'm Kieran and I develop Websites!

### 🔭 I build Single Page and Progressive Web Applications, mostly using JS and it's frameworks.
I enjoy working with JavaScript because I can do Front-End and Back-End development in the same language.
I am proficient in React. Angular is legit, but I still prefer react working in react because you have to build components from scratch, which makes me love my code more.  I like doing markdown for content editing since it sources so nicely with gatsby. I'm learning the finer points of back-end development and I enjoy JAM Stacks.

Note: I may have wiped out my git history pre-February 2020. I thought I was cleaning up my repos by adding them all to one directory and sourcing from there. I wasn't and it didn't... o_0 Made a big mess, but I have most of my repos pre-August 2020 fixed, when I began bootcamp. You live, you learn, you break it, you fix it. Thanks for your understanding and
